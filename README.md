# Topic-Modeling

## What is Topic Modeling?
> Topic models can help to organize and offer insights for us to understand large collections of unstructured text bodies. Originally developed as a text-mining tool, topic models have been used to detect instructive structures in data such as genetic information, images, and networks.

# BERTopic
> BERTopic is a topic modeling technique that leverages ðŸ¤— transformers and c-TF-IDF to create dense clusters allowing for easily interpretable topics whilst keeping important words in the topic descriptions.
> BERTopic supports guided, (semi-) supervised, and dynamic topic modeling. It even supports visualizations similar to LDAvis!
